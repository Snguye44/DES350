		<h1>DEITER RAMS <br>10 DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h1>
		<p class="p1">DES 350 - SARAH NGUYEN</p>

	<div class="one">
			<h2>01</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>INNOVATIVE:</h3>
				<p>INNOVATIONS EXPLORE THE NEEDS AND WANTS ACCORDING TO THE TIME IT WAS MADE. IT IS AN ONGOING CONCEPT WHERE THERE ARE CONSTANTLY NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND ALONG WITH IT COMES NEW CHALLENGES TO SOLVE. </p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="two">
			<h2>02</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>USEFUL:</h3>
				<p>A WELL-DESIGNED OBJECT SHOULD <br>HAVE A BOLD EMPHASIS ON THE PRACTICALITY AND FUNCTION. <br>IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM IN A USEFUL WAY. THE FORM AND FUNCTION SHOULD BE THE GUIDING FORCE BEHIND ITS DESIGN.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="three">
			<h2>03</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>AESTHETICALLY<br>PLEASING:</h3>
				<p>AN AESTHETICALLY PLEASING DESIGN CAN DRAW THE ATTENTION OF ITS VIEWERS. IT USES DESIGN TO PROVIDE AN APPEALING AND CONSISTENT VISUAL GUIDE TO GIVE USERS A BETTER OVERALL EXPERIENCE WHILE USING THE PRODUCT.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="four">
			<h2>04</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>UNDERSTANDABLE</h3>
				<p>INNOVATIONS EXPLORE THE NEEDS AND WANTS ACCORDING TO THE TIME IT WAS MADE. IT IS AN ONGOING CONCEPT WHERE THERE ARE CONSTANTLY NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND ALONG WITH IT COMES NEW CHALLENGES TO SOLVE. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="five">
			<h2>05</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>UNOBTRUSIVE:</h3>
				<p>PRODUCTS SHOULD ALLOW THE USER TO FEEL COMFORT AND A SENSE OF SELF EXPRESSION WHEN USING THE OBJECT. THEY SHOULD FEEL NATURAL TO USE. PRODUCTS ARE MEANT TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="six">
			<h2>06</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>HONEST:</h3>
				<p>A GOOD DESIGN DOES NOT HAVE UNNEEDED BELLS AND WHISTLES THAT DISTRACT A PERSON FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF THE PRODUCT IS. AN HONEST DESIGN IS ONE THAT DOES NOT TRICK ITS VIEWERS WITH COMPLEXITY.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="seven">
			<h2>07</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>LONG-LASTING:</h3>
				<p>GOOD DESIGN SHOULD BE MADE TO LAST AND HAVE MEANING. IT IS MEANT TO LAST THE CONSUMER LONG PERIODS OF TIME AS OPPOSED TO CHEAPER OR TEMPORARILY TRENDY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SHORTER LIFESPANS.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="eight">
			<h2>08</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>THOUGHTFUL</h3>
				<p>A PRODUCT THAT IS DESIGNED WITH THOUGHTFUL AND THOROUGH RESEARCH WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE DESIGN. WITHOUT PROPERLY KNOWING THE PROBLEM OR USER IT WILL DO NO GOOD. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="nine">
			<h2>09</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>FRIENDLY TO THE<br> ENVIRONMENT:</h3>
				<p>GOOD DESIGN IS MINDFUL OF MATERIALS AND LIFECYCLES OF PRODUCTS. IT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATIONS THE WAY SOMETHING IS DESIGNED AND USED ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL WHEN IT IS NO LONGER BEING USED.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="ten">
			<h2>10</h2>
			<h3>GOOD DESIGN IS<br>SIMPLE:</h3>
				<p>A DESIGN WITH TOO MUCH GOING ON WILL ONLY CAUSE USERS FRUSTRATION. BY DESIGNING AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, THE FOCUS BECOMES HOW TO SOLVE A SPECIFIC ISSUE IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND.</p>
