<h2>Question One:<br>Your interpretation of what each of the 10 principles in the article mean.</h2>

<h3>Good Design is:</h3>

	<br>Doesn’t overcomplicate the product.</li><br>
	
<p>This article aims to show that design in not something that has to be flashy and overcomplicated. It is a process that allows for design to cater to the time period in which it’s made, the users, and functionality. All 10 principles of design work together to make design that is more than just art or short-erm products.

		<h2>Question Two:<br>An example of something you use that follows each principle as you interpret it. </h2>
		<ul>

		<div class="q2response">

		<p>Based off this reading I would consider my favorite drawing utensil as good design. It’s a very simple object yet it serves it purpose perfectly. When looking into the smaller details of the design it allows for portability and a comfortable grip. The cap also has a clip that is sturdier than most pens and can attach the end of the pen. Each pen is also easily identified based of the marks along the sides.

</ul>

		<h2>Question Three:<br>How you would or have in the past or would not apply this principle in your work.</h2>
		<ul>

		<div class="q3response">

		<p>During my second year in the design program we took a course that studied the brand Alessi. Throughout the course we were introduced to the idea of design language and the importance of the 10 design principles this article touched upon. We used these ideals to create a product as if we were designing for the brand.</p>
